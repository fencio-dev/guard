## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Fencio very seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report vulnerabilities by emailing **siddhartha.roy@elitrotechnologies.com**. We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and strive to send you regular updates about our progress.

We will not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have addressed it.

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:

*   Give us reasonable time to investigate and mitigate the issue before disclosing it publicly or to a third party.
*   Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service.
*   Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission from the account holder.

Thank you for helping keep Fencio and our users safe!
